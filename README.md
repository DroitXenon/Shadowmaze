### Introduction
A game of CC3k consists of a board 79 columns wide and 30 rows high (5 rows are reserved for displaying information).
Game play is as follows: the player character moves through a dungeon and slays enemies and collects treasure until reaching
the end of the dungeon (where the end of the dungeon is the 5th floor). A dungeon consists of different floors that consist of
chambers connected with passages.
